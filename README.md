**Key Features**: 
- Handles invalid coupon codes and/or invalid coupon eligibility gracefully. 
- The ticket displays name, day, and price for a fictional Musuem of Science & Industry ticket, utilizing original turtle designs on IDLE.

    ### Project 3: What Drink are You? (10/15/2024)
**Summary**: This Nested If Project generates a user's drink based off of their inputs to personality questions. The program has 8 available drink options. 
**Key Features**: 
- Handles invalid inputs by utilizing while loops. 
- User can repeat the game as many times as they want.
- There are 3 total rounds of questions, each containing an "either/or".

    ### Project 4: MadLibs (12/10/2024)
**Summary**: This program relies on user input to 14 questions, resulting in a unique "Day in the Life" style story. 
**Key Features**: 
- Outputs are bolded and capitalized.  
- User-friendly instructions
- Inputs including numbers become strings to ensure smooth running.

  ### Project 5: Multiplication Quiz
**Summary**: Users answer 5 multiplication questions to see 1) how many they can get correct and 2) how fast they can do it.
**Key Features**: 
- While loops are implemented to handle incorrect questions/ ability to replay the game.  
- At the end of the game, output is determined by their score/ time (ie, what type of "congratulations" the user gets)
- Multiplication questions are randomized.

  ### Project 6: CREATE TASK: a password guessing game, hangman-style (3/17-4/30/2025)
**Summary**: This program is meant to educate users on how easy it is to guess weak passwords. It does so by allowing the user to guess a password w/ a length of 4, numbers or letters. They have 5 guesses. 
**Key Features**: 
- Passwords are sorted via the strength of the password, stored within another list (compares the two and makes a selection for a filtered list)
- Uses a Boolean to determine if a guess is true for any of the 4 spaces. Adds an X if not. 
- A user has five guesses no matter how many prior guesses they get correct.
- Output changes depending on the user's success (or lack thereof). If they failed, then they see how long it usually takes for someone to guess that password

  ### Project 7: List Scavenger Hunt (3/13/2025)
**Summary**: Varying levels of difficulty dealing w/ list sorting & finding items within it. Basically practice problems.
**Key Features**: 
- Calculates average of a list
